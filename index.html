      <p id="me">
        My name is Beckett Padgett. I am currently enrolled at Base Camp Coding
        Academy: Graduate Institute. BCCA:GI is a nonprofit organization built
        for giving inhabitants of North Mississippi an opportunity to learn or
        further grow their coding skills. I've learned many professional skills
        on top of technical skills that allow me to use my unique way of
        thinking and solving problems to complete projects in an unorthodox, yet
        efficient and clean way.

      <h1>Big project #1</h1>
      <p>
        My first big project when learning python was a character creator for
        Dungeons & Dragons. Me and four of my classmated wanted to make an
        application that automated everything that didn't require direct user
        input. There was a functionality to calculate all the stats, as well as
        a leveling up system that involved accessing a huge (by our standards)
        database

      <h1>Big Project #2</h1>
      <p>
        The second project of Python was a programmable cookbook with a search
        function. You could search for recipes by keywords such as "spicy" and
        "fish", or you could just look at all the recipes you could make based
        on what was in your fridge. Admittedly, this program is currently
        incomplete, because we were the smallest group(3) and had the smallest
        timeframe to work within(1 week)
